Module 9 Assignment


This repository contains the files for the module 9 assignment. In the EmployeeSQL folder, there is data folder containing all the csv files that were pulled, the ERD image labled Employees_ERD.png, the table schema used to create the tables in SQL and import the data (Employee_table_creation.sql) and the file for the data queries (Employee_data_analysis.sql). 

Note for the queries: PgAdmin would stop working sometimes when querying some of the tables because of how many rows of data there are. The assignment did not specify to limit results so "LIMIT" was not added to the queries, but I noted which queries should have limits added so that PGAdmin does not break trying to run the query.
